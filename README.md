Food Ordering Web Application

FoodTime - MERN stack food ordering application.

Overview: 
      Our Food Ordering Web Application provides a seamless experience for users to register and log in, where their details are securely stored in a MongoDB collection
      after password hashing. Upon successful registration and login, users are directed to the application's homepage, showcasing a variety of food items available for ordering.
      The application is designed to accommodate two types of users: Consumers and Restaurant Managers. Restaurant Managers have the ability to add their restaurants by providing relevant 
      information. Additionally, they can manage their restaurant's menu by adding, updating, or deleting food items.
      On the homepage, users can view food items displayed as images. Clicking on an image will provide detailed information about the selected food item,
      enhancing the user experience and facilitating informed decision-making
